## Introduction

Spam messages are unsolicited and often unwanted messages sent in bulk, typically for advertising purposes. Detecting spam messages is crucial for protecting users from scams and unwanted content. This project focuses on building a spam detection system using machine learning techniques.

## Dataset Description

The dataset consists of SMS messages labeled as either "ham" (non-spam) or "spam." It contains a total of 5,574 messages in English.

## Data Visualization

The project includes visualization of the dataset for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and model evaluation. Visualizations include:
- Count plot of target classes
- Pair plot of features with hue as target
- Box plot of text lengths

## Algorithms Used

Four different machine learning algorithms are used for spam detection:
- Multinomial Naive Bayes
- Random Forest
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## Evaluation Measures

Model performance is evaluated using various evaluation measures, including:
- Confusion matrix
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- Sensitivity
- Specificity
- False Positive Rate (FPR)
- False Negative Rate (FNR)
- Negative Predictive Value (NPV)
- False Discovery Rate (FDR)
- Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC)
